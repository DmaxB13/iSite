# iSite, the official website for MC23.

 ðŸ”— Link: https://dmaxb13.github.io/iSite/

iSite is the one and only website for doing things related to the private Minecraft server MC23, with more features coming! iSite is primarly for the people playing on MC23 so if you dont, you probably wont have any reason to check out the website.

## Newest update (changelog):
Welcome to the first update of iSite. This update is kinda small adding a player list of the players whitelisted on MC23 and what date they were whitelisted, minecraft username and skin. This is not automaticly updatated every time a player changes their skin and i will be updating the skins like once a week. I also made the see all button for the companies in swedish like it was meant to be. Hope you all like this new update and the site!
